# JUMProject-SQLCommandsJAVA-
My name is Mueen Hamed. I am a JUMP trainee at the Cognixia JUMP program and my team and I have been given the responsibility to complete a task. This task
encompasses some of the skills that are required for database connectivity. Without further ado, our code consists of several methods that allow us to connect to
a live database that is hosted in US-West 1 under the AWS cloud. We have concluded with our program a J-UNIT on some of the functionality and the results came back
positive. Upon showcase of our program, we ran into a bug were a selection of inputs where not being shown on the User's interface. The issue is now resolved and
the program is functioning at optimum.
